<p>This document provides basic how-to information that should help get you
started with integrating your Rails application with a PostGIS database. We
cover three parts:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>How to install the adapter, and how to configure your database.yml.</p>
</li><li>
<p>How to set up and configure spatial columns and tables.</p>
</li><li>
<p>How to read, write, and query spatial data.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>This document is part of the distribution for the
activerecord-postgis-adapter gem. For more information, please visit <a
href="http://dazuma.github.com/activerecord-postgis-adapter">dazuma.github.com/activerecord-postgis-adapter</a>.</p>

<h2 id="label-Installation+and+Configuration">Installation and Configuration<span><a href="#label-Installation+and+Configuration">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<h3 id="label-General+Installation+Considerations">General Installation Considerations<span><a href="#label-General+Installation+Considerations">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Generally, we recommend starting with the latest versions of Ruby, Rails,
PostgreSQL, and PostGIS. As of this writing, those are Ruby 2.0.0, Rails
3.2, PostgreSQL 9.2, and PostGIS 2.0. If you cannot upgrade, the minimum
supported configuration is the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Ruby 1.8.7</p>
</li><li>
<p>Rails 3.0.3</p>
</li><li>
<p>PostgreSQL 9.0</p>
</li><li>
<p>PostGIS 1.5</p>
</li></ul>

<p>However, older software versions can make for a more involved setup
process, so we recommend using the latest available if possible.</p>

<p>As of this writing, Rails 4.0.0 release candidate 1 has just been released.
This version of activerecord-postgis-adapter does support Rails 4, but
because the software is still pre-release, the usual caveats apply. If you
are running Rails 4, you must be on the release candidate or later; the
beta 1 release is not supported.</p>

<p>JRuby and the JDBC Postgres Adapter is supported. But, as of this writing,
the JDBC adapters themselves are not yet compatible with Rails 4.</p>

<h3 id="label-Creating+a+Spatial+Rails+App">Creating a Spatial Rails App<span><a href="#label-Creating+a+Spatial+Rails+App">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>This section covers starting a new Rails application from scratch. If you
need to add geospatial capabilities to an existing Rails application (i.e.
you need to convert a non-spatial database to a spatial database), see the
section on “Upgrading a Database With Spatial Features” below.</p>

<p>To create a new Rails application using activerecord-postgis-adapter, start
by using the postgresql adapter.</p>

<pre>rails new my_app --database=postgresql</pre>

<p>Next, add the activerecord-postgis-adapter gem to the Gemfile as follows:</p>

<pre>gem 'activerecord-postgis-adapter'</pre>

<p>We also recommend including the “squeel” gem, which comes in very useful
for writing spatial queries. Then run <code>bundle install</code> to
complete your bundle.</p>

<p>The adapter includes a railtie that provides specialized rake tasks for
managing spatial databases. Earlier versions of this adapter required you
to load that railtie explicitly by adding a certain require statement to
your <code>config/application.rb</code>. As of version 0.6, that explicit
require statement is no longer necessary. If your code already has that
require statement, it will not harm anything in this version, but it is
considered deprecated.</p>

<p>Next, you need to modify your <code>config/database.yml</code> file to
invoke the postgis adapter, and to provide additional information it may
need to set up a new database with spatial features. For example, at
minimum, you will need to change the <code>adapter</code> field from
“postgresql” to “postgis”. Please see the Configuration sections below to
see how to set up your database configs properly before proceeding.</p>

<p>Once you have set up your database configs, you should be able to run:</p>

<pre>rake db:create</pre>

<p>to create your development database. The adapter will automatically add the
PostGIS spatial definitions to your database.</p>

<p>When you create your production database, you’ll also need to add PostGIS
to that database. The adapter does not provide rake tasks for setting up
your production database; you will have to do that yourself. Generally,
that means logging into your newly created production database and running,
as a superuser:</p>

<pre>CREATE EXTENSION postgis;</pre>

<p>For more information, see the PostGIS documentation, or any relevant
documentation provided by your hosting service.</p>

<h3 id="label-Upgrading+an+Existing+Database+With+Spatial+Features">Upgrading an Existing Database With Spatial Features<span><a href="#label-Upgrading+an+Existing+Database+With+Spatial+Features">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>If you have an existing Rails app and an existing database that uses
Postgres, and you want to add geospatial features, you should follow these
steps.</p>

<p>First, add the activerecord-postgis-adapter gem to the Gemfile, and update
your bundle by running <code>bundle install</code>.</p>

<p>Next, modify your <code>config/database.yml</code> file to invoke the
postgis adapter, as described above. At minimum, you will need to change
the <code>adapter</code> field from “postgresql” to “postgis”.</p>

<p>Once you have set up your database configs, run:</p>

<pre>rake db:gis:setup</pre>

<p>This rake task adds the PostGIS extension to your existing development
database.</p>

<p>Prior to deployment, you will also need to add the PostGIS extension to
your production database. Generally, that means logging into your
production database and running, as a superuser:</p>

<pre>CREATE EXTENSION postgis;</pre>

<p>For more information, see the PostGIS documentation, or any relevant
documentation provided by your hosting service.</p>

<h3 id="label-Recommended+Configuration">Recommended Configuration<span><a href="#label-Recommended+Configuration">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Setting up the database.yml is a bit of an art. In this section, we’ll
cover a recommended configuration to get you started. This should be
sufficient for most cases. We’ll cover some of the alternate configuration
options in more detail in the next section.</p>

<p>Assuming you have at least PostgreSQL 9.2 and PostGIS 2.0, the following is
the recommended configuration:</p>

<pre>development:
  adapter: postgis
  encoding: unicode
  postgis_extension: true
  schema_search_path: public,postgis
  pool: 5
  database: my_app_development    # substitute your dev database name
  username: my_app_user           # substitute the username your app will use to connect
  password: my_app_password       # substitute the user's password
  su_username: my_global_user     # substitute a superuser for the database
  su_password: my_global_pasword  # substitute the superuser's password</pre>

<p>The adapter name <em>must</em> be set to “postgis” to invoke the adapter.</p>

<p>The <code>postgis_extension</code> tells the adapter to add the PostGIS
extension to the database when the database is created (i.e. <code>rake
db:create</code>). If it is missing, you will need to add PostGIS to your
database through some other mechanism.</p>

<p>The <code>schema_search_path</code> is an important value. If you include a
schema called “postgis” in the search path, the adapter will isolate all
the PostGIS-specific definitions, including data types, functions, views,
and so forth, into that schema instead of including them in the default
“public” schema. Then, when Rails needs to dump the schema (for example, to
replicate it for the test database), it can use that isolation to omit the
PostGIS definitions from cluttering the schema dump.</p>

<p>The credentials that your app will use to connect to the database should be
given in the <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> fields.
Generally, for security reasons, it is not a good idea for this user to
have “superuser” privileges. However, the adapter <em>does</em> need
superuser privileges for one function: installing PostGIS into the database
when the database is first created. Therefore, you should provide a
<em>second</em> set of credentials, <code>su_username</code> and
<code>su_password</code>, which identify a superuser account. This account
will be used once, when you create the database (i.e. rake db:create), and
not afterward.</p>

<h3 id="label-Alternate+Configuration+Schemes">Alternate Configuration Schemes<span><a href="#label-Alternate+Configuration+Schemes">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Here are some configuration options for other cases.</p>

<p>*If you have an older PostgreSQL or an older PostGIS* you will not be able
to use the Postgres extension mechanism to install PostGIS into your
database. In this case, instead of including
<code>postgis_extension</code>, you should include <code>script_dir</code>
in the configuration. This should be set to a directory containing two
files that contain all the PostGIS-provided spatial definitions:
<code>postgis.sql</code> and <code>spatial_ref_sys.sql</code>.</p>

<p>This directory is usually in the share/contrib directory of your PostgreSQL
installation. To find it, run</p>

<pre>pg_config --sharedir</pre>

<p>Then, append <code>contrib</code>, and look for a subdirectory named
“postgis-(version)”. For example, if you installed PostgreSQL in
/usr/local, and you are running PostGIS 1.5, you should probably set
<code>script_dir</code> to
<code>/usr/local/share/contrib/postgis-1.5</code>.</p>

<p>*If you are using a template to install PostGIS into your database* then
set the <code>template</code> configuration as appropriate, and
<em>omit</em> both the <code>postgis_extension</code> and
<code>script_dir</code> configurations. In this case, you also do not need
to include <code>su_username</code> or <code>su_password</code>, since
those configurations apply only to adding the extension or using the script
dir.</p>

<p>*If you do not want the spatial declarations to live in a separate schema*
then do <em>not</em> include “postgis” on the
<code>schema_search_path</code>. Note that we recommend separating PostGIS
into a separate schema, because that is the best way to ensure <code>rake
test</code> works properly and is able to create the test database.</p>

<h2 id="label-Spatial+Database+Structure">Spatial Database Structure<span><a href="#label-Spatial+Database+Structure">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>A spatial database is one that includes a set of data types, functions,
tables, and other objects related to geospatial data. When these objects
are present in your database, you can use them to store and query spatial
objects such as points, lines, and polygons.</p>

<p>PostGIS is a plugin for PostgreSQL that provides definitions for the
objects you need to add to a database to enable geospatial capabilities.</p>

<p>When you create your Rails database as described above in the section on
installation and configuration, activerecord-postgis-adapter automatically
invokes PostGIS to add the appropriate definitions to your database. You
can determine whether your database includes the correct definitions by
attempting to invoke the POSTGIS_VERSION function:</p>

<pre>SELECT POSTGIS_VERSION();   # succeeds if PostGIS objects are present.</pre>

<p>Standard spatial databases also include a table called
<code>spatial_ref_sys</code>. This table includes a set of “spatial
reference systems”, or coordinate systems— for example, WGS84 latitude and
longitude, or Mercator Projection. Spatial databases also usually include a
table called <code>geometry_columns</code>, which includes information on
each database column that includes geometric data. In recent versions of
PostGIS, <code>geometry_columns</code> is actually not a table but a view
into the system catalogs.</p>

<h3 id="label-Creating+Spatial+Tables">Creating Spatial Tables<span><a href="#label-Creating+Spatial+Tables">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>To store spatial data, you must create a column with a spatial type.
PostGIS provides a variety of spatial types, including point, linestring,
polygon, and different kinds of collections. These types are defined in a
standard produced by the Open Geospatial Consortium. Furthermore, you can
specify options indicating the coordinate system and number of coordinates
for the values you are storing.</p>

<p>The activerecord-postgis-adapter extends ActiveRecord’s migration syntax to
support these spatial types. The following example creates four spatial
columns in a table:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">create_table</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">my_spatial_table</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span> <span class="ruby-operator">|</span><span class="ruby-identifier">t</span><span class="ruby-operator">|</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">t</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">column</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">shape1</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">geometry</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">t</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">geometry</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">shape2</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">t</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">line_string</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">path</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">srid</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-value">3785</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">t</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">point</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">lonlat</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">geographic</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">true</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">t</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">point</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">lonlatheight</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">geographic</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">true</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">has_z</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">true</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>The first column, “shape1”, is created with type “geometry”. This is a
general “base class” for spatial types; the column declares that it can
contain values of <em>any</em> spatial type. The second column, “shape2”,
uses a shorthand syntax for the same type. Like “normal” types, you can
create a column either by invoking <code>column</code> or invoking the name
of the type directly.</p>

<p>The third column, “path”, has a specific geometric type,
<code>line_string</code>. It also specifies an SRID (spatial reference ID)
that indicates which coordinate system it expects the data to be in. The
column now has a “constraint” on it; it will accept only LineString data,
and only data whose SRID is 3785.</p>

<p>The fourth column, “lonlat”, has the <code>point</code> type, and accepts
only Point data. Furthermore, it declares the column as “geographic”, which
means it accepts longitude/latitude data, and performs calculations such as
distances using a spheroidal domain.</p>

<p>The fifth column, “lonlatheight”, is a geographic (longitude/latitude)
point that also includes a third “z” coordinate that can be used to store
height information.</p>

<p>The following are the data types understood by PostGIS and exposed by
activerecord-postgis-adapter:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><code>:geometry</code> -- Any geometric type</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>:point</code> -- Point data</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>:line_string</code> -- LineString data</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>:polygon</code> -- Polygon data</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>:geometry_collection</code> -- Any collection type</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>:multi_point</code> -- A collection of Points</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>:multi_line_string</code> -- A collection of LineStrings</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>:multi_polygon</code> -- A collection of Polygons</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Following are the options understood by the adapter:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><code>:geographic</code> -- If set to true, create a PostGIS geography
column for longitude/latitude data over a spheroidal domain; otherwise
create a geometry column in a flat coordinate system. Default is false.
Also implies :srid set to 4326.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>:srid</code> -- Set a SRID constraint for the column. Default is 4326
for a geography column, or -1 for a geometry column. Note that PostGIS
currently (as of version 2.0) requires geography columns to have SRID 4326,
so this constraint is of limited use for geography columns.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>:has_z</code> -- Specify that objects in this column include a Z
coordinate. Default is false.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>:has_m</code> -- Specify that objects in this column include an M
coordinate. Default is false.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The adapter also extends the ActiveRecord migration syntax for creating
spatial indexes. To create a PostGIS spatial index, simply set the :spatial
option to true, as follows:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">change_table</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">my_spatial_table</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span> <span class="ruby-operator">|</span><span class="ruby-identifier">t</span><span class="ruby-operator">|</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">t</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">index</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">lonlat</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">spatial</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">true</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<h3 id="label-Configuring+the+ActiveRecord+class">Configuring the ActiveRecord class<span><a href="#label-Configuring+the+ActiveRecord+class">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>ActiveRecord’s usefulness stems from the way it automatically configures
classes based on the database structure and schema. If a column in the
database has an integer type, ActiveRecord automatically casts the data to
a Ruby Integer. In the same way, the activerecord-postgis-adapter
automatically casts spatial data to a corresponding RGeo data type.</p>

<p>However, RGeo offers more “flexibility” in its type system than can be
interpreted solely from analyzing the database column. For example, you can
configure RGeo objects to exhibit certain behaviors related to their
serialization, validation, coordinate system, or computation. These
settings are embodied in the RGeo “factory” associated with the object.</p>

<p>Therefore, you can configure the adapter to use a particular factory (i.e.
a particular combination of settings) for data associated with each column
in the database. This is done by calling class methods on the ActiveRecord
class associated with that database table. Specifically, you can call
<code>set_rgeo_factory_for_column</code> to set the factory that
ActiveRecord uses for a particular column.</p>

<p>You can also provide a “factory generator” function which takes information
from the database column and returns a suitable factory. Set the factory
generator by setting the <code>rgeo_factory_generator</code> class
attribute of your ActiveRecord class. The generator should be a callable
object that takes a hash that could include the following keys:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><code>:srid</code> -- the SRID of the database column</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>:has_z_coordinate</code> -- true if the database column has a Z
coordinate</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>:has_m_coordinate</code> -- true if the database column has a M
coordinate</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>:geographic</code> -- true if the database column is geographic
instead of geometric</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Here are some examples, given the spatial table defined above:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-keyword">class</span> <span class="ruby-constant">MySpatialTable</span> <span class="ruby-operator">&lt;</span> <span class="ruby-constant">ActiveRecord</span><span class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">Base</span>

  <span class="ruby-comment"># By default, use the GEOS implementation for spatial columns.</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">self</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">rgeo_factory_generator</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">RGeo</span><span class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">Geos</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">factory_generator</span>

  <span class="ruby-comment"># But use a geographic implementation for the :lonlat column.</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">set_rgeo_factory_for_column</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">lonlat</span>, <span class="ruby-constant">RGeo</span><span class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">Geographic</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">spherical_factory</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">srid</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-value">4326</span>))

<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>The <code>rgeo_factory_generator</code> attribute and
<code>set_rgeo_factory_for_column</code> method are actually implemented
(and documented) in the “rgeo-activerecord” gem, which is a dependency of
the activerecord-postgis-adapter.</p>

<h3 id="label-Schema+Dump+and+Reload">Schema Dump and Reload<span><a href="#label-Schema+Dump+and+Reload">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>The presence of geospatial data in a database causes some issues with
ActiveRecord’s schema dump and restore functions. This is because (1)
installing PostGIS into your database injects a lot of objects in your
database that can clutter up schema dumps, and (2) to define a spatial
column correctly, you generally must call a SQL function such as
AddGeometryColumn(), and Rails’s schema dumper isn’t smart enough to
reproduce those function calls.</p>

<p>Because of this, we recommend the following.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Install the PostGIS definitions in a separate schema called “postgis” (as
described in the recommended installation procedure above). The
activerecord-postgis-adapter will ignore a schema called “postgis” when
dumping the schema, thus omitting the clutter.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Set the ActiveRecord schema format to <code>:ruby</code>, <em>not</em>
<code>:sql</code>. The former emits higher level commands that can be
interpreted correctly to reproduce the schema. The latter, however, emits
low level SQL, which loses information such as the fact that
AddGeometryColumn() was originally used to generate a column. Executing a
<code>:sql</code> format schema dump will <em>not</em> correctly reproduce
the schema.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Of course, the above discussion is really relevant only if you are using
the ActiveRecord rake tasks that create and restore databases, either
directly such as <code>rake db:create</code> or indirectly such as
<code>rake test</code>. It does not have any effect on running migrations
or normal website execution.</p>

<h2 id="label-Working+With+Spatial+Data">Working With Spatial Data<span><a href="#label-Working+With+Spatial+Data">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>Of course, you’re using this adapter because you want to work with
geospatial data in your ActiveRecord models. Once you’ve installed the
adapter, set up your database, and run your migrations, you can interact
directly with spatial data in your models as RGeo objects.</p>

<p>RGeo is a Ruby implementation of the industry standard OGC Simple Features
specification. It’s a set of data types that can represent a variety of
geospatial objects such as points, lines, polygons, and collections. It
also provides the standard set of spatial analysis operations such as
computing intersections or bounding boxes, calculating length or area, and
so forth. We recommend browsing the RGeo documentation for a clearer
understanding of its capabilities. For now, just note that the data values
you will be working with are all RGeo geometry objects.</p>

<h3 id="label-Reading+and+Writing+Spatial+Columns">Reading and Writing Spatial Columns<span><a href="#label-Reading+and+Writing+Spatial+Columns">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>When you access a spatial attribute on your ActiveRecord model, it is given
to you as an RGeo geometry object (or nil, for attributes that allow null
values). You can then call the RGeo api on the object. For example,
consider the MySpatialTable class we worked with above:</p>

<pre>record = MySpatialTable.find(1)
p = record.lonlat                  # Returns an RGeo::Feature::Point
puts p.x                           # displays the x coordinate
puts p.geometry_type.type_name     # displays &quot;Point&quot;</pre>

<p>The RGeo factory for the value is determined by how you configured the
ActiveRecord class, as described above. In this case, we explicitly set a
spherical factory for the <code>:lonlat</code> column:</p>

<pre>factory = p.factory                # returns a spherical factory</pre>

<p>You can set a spatial attribute by providing an RGeo geometry object, or by
providing the WKT string representation of the geometry. If a string is
provided, the activerecord-postgis-adapter will attempt to parse it as WKT
and set the value accordingly.</p>

<pre>record.lonlat = 'POINT(-122, 47)'  # sets the value to the given point</pre>

<p>If the WKT parsing fails, the value currently will be silently set to nil.
In the future, however, this will raise an exception.</p>

<pre>record.lonlat = 'POINT(x)'         # sets the value to nil</pre>

<p>If you set the value to an RGeo object, the factory needs to match the
factory for the attribute. If the factories do not match,
activerecord-postgis-adapter will attempt to cast the value to the correct
factory.</p>

<pre>p2 = factory.point(-122, 47)       # p2 is a point in a spherical factory
record.lonlat = p2                 # sets the value to the given point
record.shape1 = p2                 # shape1 uses a flat geos factory, so it
                                   # will cast p2 into that coordinate system
                                   # before setting the value
record.save</pre>

<p>If, however, you attempt to set the value to the wrong type– for example,
setting a linestring attribute to a point value, you will get an exception
from Postgres when you attempt to save the record.</p>

<pre>record.path = p2      # This will appear to work, but...
record.save           # This will raise an exception from the database</pre>

<h3 id="label-Spatial+Queries">Spatial Queries<span><a href="#label-Spatial+Queries">&para;</a> <a href="#documentation">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>You can create simple queries based on representational equality in the
same way you would on a scalar column:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">record2</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">MySpatialTable</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">where</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">lonlat</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">factory</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">point</span>(<span class="ruby-value">-122</span>, <span class="ruby-value">47</span>)).<span class="ruby-identifier">first</span>
</pre>

<p>You can also use WKT:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">record3</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">MySpatialTable</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">where</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">lonlat</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-string">'POINT(-122 47)'</span>).<span class="ruby-identifier">first</span>
</pre>

<p>Note that these queries use representational equality, meaning they return
records where the lonlat value matches the given value exactly. A 0.00001
degree difference would not match, nor would a different representation of
the same geometry (like a multipoint with a single element). Equality
queries aren’t generally all that useful in real world applications.
Typically, if you want to perform a spatial query, you’ll look for, say,
all the points within a given area. For those queries, you’ll need to use
the standard spatial SQL functions provided by PostGIS.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Rails by itself doesn’t provide good support for embedding
arbitrary function calls in your where clause. You could get around this by
writing raw SQL. But the solution we recommend is to use the “squeel” gem.
This gem extends the ActiveRecord syntax to support more complex queries.</p>

<p>Let’s say you wanted to find all records whose lonlat fell within a
particular polygon. In the query, you can accomplish this by calling the
ST_Intersects() SQL function on the lonlat and the polygon. That is, you’d
want to generate SQL that looks something like this:</p>

<pre>SELECT * FROM my_spatial_table WHERE ST_Intersects(lonlat, &lt;i&gt;my-polygon&lt;/i&gt;);</pre>

<p>Using squeel, you can write this as follows:</p>

<pre>my_polygon = get_my_polygon()       # Obtain the polygon as an RGeo geometry
MySpatialTable.where{st_intersects(lonlat, my_polygon)}.first</pre>

<p>Notice the curly brackets instead of parentheses in the where clause. This
is how to write squeel queries: squeel is actually a DSL, and you’re
passing a block to the where method instead of an argument list. Also note
that Squeel requires ActiveRecord 3.1 or later to handle SQL function calls
such as ST_Intersects.</p>

<p>As another example, one common query is to find all objects displaying in a
window. This can be done using the overlap (&amp;&amp;) operator with a
bounding box. Here’s an example that finds linestrings in the “path” column
that intersect a bounding box:</p>

<pre>sw = get_sw_corner_in_projected_coordinates()
ne = get_ne_corner_in_projected_coordinates()
window = RGeo::Cartesian::BoundingBox.create_from_points(sw, ne)
MySpatialTable.where{path.op('&amp;&amp;', window)}.all</pre>

<p>Note that bounding box queries make sense only in a projected coordinate
system; you shouldn’t try to run such a query against a lat/long
(geographic) column.</p>
